#Assignment 10

## AA Meetings:

The first interface represents the AA Meetings Data, this interface corresponds to the default settings in the primary search bar, if wanted the user can further refine the search by inputing more precise data into the primary search bar. There are also more advanced filters for things like wheelchair access and special interests. There is also a color code for the type of meetings making it easier for users to know what they are looking for. When hovering each meeting on the list on the right the corresponding pin on the map should change color to indicate exact location.

## Habit Diary:

This interface is meant to display the positive habits that the user has accomplished during a giving month. The entries are categorized in 5 main groups corresponding to intelectual activities, business activities, leisure & travel, social & family and physical & fitness activities. The idea is that the user can have a clear view of what he/she is spending its time on. It is pretty common that people do the urgent things more so than the important thing. This visualization seeks that the user understand where he/she is spending their time on and also to release anxiety about not being productive enough.

## Temperature Sensor:

This interface seeks to visualize the data from the sensors using both humidity and temperature. This simple graphic allows for the user to change views from Monthly, Weekly, Daily and Hourly. In this manner it can have more control on the visualization and changes throughout time.

Disclaimer: I understand this UI are not easy to achieve in code but I will be happy if I can do my best shot to try and build something as similar as possible from what I have presented in my designs.
